    <h4 class="col-sm">My app that I chose to make was hangman and making it more complicated than the original design.   For me to achieve this I had to add a timer and random theme generator.   During this assessment I faced many issues with figuring out how to randomly generating a theme while generating the random word to go with it.  I also struggled with the timer to ensure it counted down and sent the user to the losing screen once the timer hit zero.   To fix the timer issue I had to set the timer function to take off a second after one second instead of the set time of every 5 seconds, and then I had to connect the label used for the timer and have it count down to zero.  Once the timer hit zero I had the program navigate to screen 2 where it told the user they lost.  After I fixed the timer I worked on creating a random theme generator.  To create a random generator I had to create a variable that would randomly choose a variable while still choosing a random word from that list and would move to the next screens if the word was right or wrong.  In the end creating a complex hangman app allowed me to get an introduction to simple coding, problem solve with technology, and create complex code to make a working app.</h4>
