  <h4 class="text-center"> Within this video I made sure I showed two working functions.  The first function is using commands.  The user is given two options for commands, y for yes and n for no.  Both of these inputs allow the story to move foward or restart to the intro.  The second comand is clearing the text above the next command.  While my partner and I were programming we realized there was too much text as the story progressed, so we inputed a function to have the text disappear after each choice.</h4>

  <h5 class="text-center">A young scrawny Irish squire(Gerald) helps his master (Sir Snotlout), a well respected jouster and knight of the kingdom. After Cummascach, the King of the land, asks for another knight to join him in his noble guard. To become the next knight the king will host a tournament filled with lifting, jousting, and fighting. After hearing this news Gerald argues with Snotlout about joining the tournament. After leaving upset Gerald decides to join the tournament no matter what people say.  While training for the tournament Gerald meets a fair young lady with large arms, long red hair, and a heavy, thick, sexy accent named Godiva.  After a long night of drinking, Gerald thinks he finds his love within Godiva and wants to marry her.  As the weeks pass with rigorous training, Gerald feels prepared to face his old master and become a noble knight at the nice height of 5’8.  Once Gerald reaches the tournament, he sees his lovely fair lady, swole and ready, taking part in the tournament herself. That comes as a complete shock as Gerald thought her big arms came from cooking and cleaning.  As the day goes on, Godiva keeps winning her battles, and Gerald is about to compete against her. The event they must take part in is jousting.  In an unsurprising move, Godiva kicks Geralds’ ass and he becomes very injured. After seeing her new love injured, Godiva rushes over to see how he is. After attending to Gerald’s injuries, Godiva must face Snotlout in an intense duel with swords and shields.  After a back-and-forth match, Godiva lands a pivotal blow that allows her to defeat Snotlout. In the coming months after the tournament, Gerald heals from his wounds, Godiva becomes the king’s new knight, and Gerald askes Godiva if he can take her hand in marriage. Sir Snotlout, the disgraced knight, retires soon after he loses to Godiva. He eventually returns to the king and asks for a position as a squire. He humbly asks for Gerald’s forgiveness for his mistreatment all those years and Gerald and Snotlout become fast friends,often reuniting to share tales and memories of knighthood (and squirehood) over some beer.

    <h5 class="text-center">For this project my partner and I wanted to make a comedy filled adventure. We decided to use old century, Irsih, and something with knights.  While we were coding we did face two issues that caused us some trouble.  The first of the two was trying to figure out to clear text as the story continues.  After many trials we figured out that we could clear the text if we put the command after the input of a certian function. Another issue we faced was creating a command that would restarted the game.  I figured out we could have a simple poitn, like an underscore, that can loop back to the start of the game.  In conclusion this project was fun, insightful, and a great learning expirence.</h5>
