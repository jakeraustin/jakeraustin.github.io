            <th><p> Flying high above everyone.  That is what I think about when I think about my dream job.  I want to go to a four year college and earn a degree in applied science for aviation.  Once I earn my degree I want to finish getting my pilot's license.  Once I do this I want to get a job at a major airline.  I want to work at an airline because it cobines two passions of mine, helping people and flying.  In conclusion aviation ia my passion and something I want to do in my life.  
</p>

<br>
<p2> Through my seventeen years of life I have found out a lot about myself and grown as a person.  Through school I have become hungry and ambitious through my school work and passion with aviation.  I also through this hard work I believe I have become a great people person.  With these great peronality traits I have completed some of my best achievements in my young life.  I have become a student pilot with over 20 hours of flight time and I have met some of the top empolyees in the operations at Southwest Airlines.  I have also kept a GPA of 4.28 through the course of highschool.

<br> 
<p3> All of these expiernces have tought me important life skills and common sense.  I know how to repair issues with my car, such as, changing the oil and changing a tire.  I aslo use these lessons to help those around me like my younger sister and my friends who may be younger.  In the end I know I have so much to learn and room to mature from the things I have seen and done.

<br>
<p4> In conclsuion my seventeen short years of life have allowed me to adopt a hard work ethic and experince things some kids only imagine.  I have found my passion at a young age with a supportive family around me and many other people.
