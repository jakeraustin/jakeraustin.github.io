    <h4 class="text-center">In this video I made sure to show off all the basic features of the program.  The first of the features was logging in, the user must use the 4 digit pin given.  After using the pin the code takes you to the main menu where 4 options are given, deposit, transfer, withdraw, and check balance.  When the user selects deposit, it shows their current balance and allows them to add as much moneyas they want and then return to the main menu.  Withdraw allows the person to withdraw any amount as long as it doesn't go over the account's balance. The last function seen is the check balance function which simplies print the balance even if money has been added or taken out.</h4>

    <h5 class="text-center">For this python project my partner and I decided to make a working bank account.  Once the user used the proper pin number it gained the access to the mainmenu.  Once there the user could either deposit, withdraw, transfer, or check their balance.  Each function worked according to their intended purpose. You were allowed to deposit money into your account and it would change the balance amount or withdraw money, taking money out of the account.  The one issue we ran into was insurring the user couldn't withdraw more money then whats in their account.  But we fixed it by making a variable that wouldn't allow an amount more then the balance to be taken out.  In conclusion this project was fun and helped me learn complex functions and skills for future projects.</h5>
